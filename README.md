<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Safari is apart of my personal project where I exercise and showcase my design skills by transforming them into a fully functional website through coding. Safari is envisioned as a road trip planner and tracker, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Safari isn't just a project; it's like your best buddy for road trips. It does smart trip planning, tracks your route in real-time, suggests cool spots with AI, and connects you with a bunch of fellow road trippers. It's made for solo adventurers, families exploring, or groups of friends on a mission to discover new places. Safari is all about making your road trip awesome, mixing design, coding, and practical features to ensure you have a blast.</p>
